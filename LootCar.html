        Jokes on you kid, none of the cars nearby have anything. No wonder why there are so many
        of the DEAD walking around.

        You skim through the car and coudn't find anything. But one car had toys, like kid toys.
        You started to have a headace //your kid memories//

        HAHAHHA reminds you of him doesn't it. You used to take care of that little guy so well
