    <p>Why are you walking on this dirt? Look there is a road nearby why don't we walk?

    <br><br>

    You got tierd lisniting to the voice in the head and it woudn't shut up unless you do what 
    it says.

    <br><br>
    You feel a breeze on your face, its so pure. It reminds you about certain someone, about your
    beautiful wife.......

    <br><br>
    You suddendly come back to reality, and you see yourself standing in front of the DEAD, not
    one, a whole bunch.

    <br><br>
    Its so weird, you don't know how you got there in the frist place, but you don't have time to
    think about that, your priority is to get away from this DEADS.
