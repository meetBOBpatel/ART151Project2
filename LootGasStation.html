    <p>
        It's the same old feeling, none of any gas staion remains full anymore, most of the stock
        has been trashed by people, all gone.
        <br><br>
        Well why don't you eat rotten food then? Food is food no matter what, you won't get sick
        I promise.
        <br><br>
        You ignored and suddendly hear a noise, what should you do? Do you want to ignore and
        <a href="RunAway.html">run away</a> or you don't care and 
        <a href="FindOutSounds.html">move towards</a> it and find out?
